#Chapter 1
##Definition of Systematic Theology
Any study that answers the question, "What does the whole Bible teach us today?"
###Relationship to Other Disciplines
Wayne Grudems study doesn't focus on historical, philosophical or apologetic study but uses these tools to look at what the Bible says about various theological subjects.

Three other disciplines include *Old Testament Theology*, *New Testament Theology* and *Biblical Theology*. These answer questions like what can Deuteronomy say about prayer or what does Matthew say abut prayer. The question we seek to answer is what does the whole Bible say about prayer.

###Application to Life
Systematic Theology seeks to summarize doctrine as it applies to Christians today. Application is necessary to the pursuit of systematic theology. This aligns to the writers purpose of writing for practical application, not in isoloation from life.

###Systematic Theology and Disorganized Theology
This should be a study "carefully orgnanized by topics" to enhance the understanding of Biblical followers.
It should cover subjects in great detail to provide readers the ability tosummarize biblical teachings with much more accuracy.
The study must treat all scripture fairly and take into account arguments on all sides. 
This will require exegesis (interpretation) of various scriptures.
All study depends on scripture and the readers should not hold any beliefs strictly as a result of this book or any other earthly authority without being fully convinced and carefully considering for themselves that such beliefs are justified using scripture.

###What are the doctrines?
Doctrine is what the whole Bible teaches us today about some particular topic.

####The seven sections of Biblical doctrine covered:
Part 1: The Doctrine of the Word of God<br />
Part 2: The Doctrine of God<br />
Part 3: The Doctrine of Man<br />
Part 4: The Doctrine of Christ and the Holy Spirit<br />
Part 5: The Doctrine of the Application of Redemption<br />
Part 6: The Doctrine of the Church<br />
Part 7: The Doctrine of the Future

The emphasis of systemmatic theology is *what does God want us to believe and to know* while the emphasis of Christian ethics is *what God wants us to do and what attitudes we should seek to have*. Theology is about how we should think and ethics is about how we should live. This book will focus on what to think but will touch on application as it is the true value of having formed Biblically-aligned thinking.

##Initial Assumptions of This Book
(1) that the Bible is true and it is the absolute standard of truth.<br />
(2) God as referenced in the Bible exists and he is who the Bible says he is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creator of heaven and earth and all things in them

##Why Should Christians Study Theology?
Why is simply reading the Bible not enough, why should we enter into a deeper study of the word?
###The Basic Reason
Matthew 28:19-20<br />
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father an dof the Son and of the Holy Spirit, **teaching** them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age.<br />
To teach "all that Jesus commanded" includes the interpretation and application of his life and teachings. Acts implies it is the narrative of what Jesus *continued to do* and as the Epistles (An epistle (/ɨˈpɪsəl/; Greek ἐπιστολή, epistolē, "letter") is a writing directed or sent to a person or group of people, usually an elegant and formal didactic (informational or instructive) letter) were written under the supervision of the Holy Spirit they are also considered to be "commanded of the Lord".

1 Corinthians 14:37<br />
If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.<br />
(See also John 14:26; 16:13; 1 Thesselonians 4:15; 2 Peter 3:2; Revelation 1:1-3)

Because Jesus affirmed the authority and reliability of the OT as absolutely authoritative words of God (see CH.4), we must study both the NT and OT to fully understand Biblical view on the new covenant age.

To effectively evangelize and *teach* we must collect and summarize all scriptural passages on a subject. While we do not need to necessarily become experts on every scriptural subject, we should be able to point any questions to appropriate scripture and a good summary of the subject; this allows the questioner to seek understanding for themselves in a non-overwhelming way.

###Benefits to Our Lives
Helps us overcome wrong ideas by forcing us to encounter a scriptural subject with a Biblical foundation in the context of the whole bible, not simply an isolated passage. 

Enables us to better discern the answers to questions about doctrine we have not necessarily looked at before.

Helps us to apply the Bible to life, like what does the bible say about marriage, raising children, witnessing to a friend, science, spending money, etc.

Helps us to grow as Christians. Knowing God and better understanding his word helps us to trust him, praise him and obey him. The Bible connects maturity in Christian living and understanding of the scriptures. (work as an apostle is 1 Timothy 6:3 the teaching which accords with godliness; Titus 1:1 to further the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth which accords with godliness) and in contrast, all kinds of disobedience and immorality are (1 Timothy 1:10 contrary to sound doctrine)

####Major vs Minor Doctrine
Major doctrine is one that has a significant impace on our thinking about other dosctrines or how we live.<br />
Minor doctrine is one that has very little impace on how we think about other doctrines and how we live.

Examples of major doctrine by this definition: authority of the Bible, diety of Christ, justification by faith. <br />
Examples of minor doctrine by this definition: forms of church government, details of Lord's supper, timing of the great tribulation.

Difference in major doctrine (as opposed to minor doctrine) can create Christian lives that differ in great ways and prevent fellowship. Understanding that minor doctrine should not be divisional is an important thing for Christians collectively and individually to recognize.

Doctrines that may fall in the middle: baptism, extent of atonement. It is important to discuss as a body what doctrines are core to our belief and which we are willing to disagree about to have organized community.

##How Should Christians Study Systematic Theology
###With Prayer
This is just one way of studying the bible; look to the Psalmist in Psalm 119:18 <br />
Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law

Seek God's help in understanding his Word. Paul says (1 Corinthians 2:14 the unspiritual man does not receive the gifts of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned) indicating this is a spiritual activity and we need the Holy Spirit's help.

Also note that there is a limit to human understanding and often we don't need more data, but God's help through the Holy Spirit (1 Cor 2:14, Eph 1:17-19)

###With Humility
1 Peter 5:5
Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for 'God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble'

The knowledge you acquire from this is to help you live a better life, to glorify God. Not to be superior in knowledge to those around you. Look at (James 1:19-20 Let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger, for th anger of man does not with the righteousness of God)

James 3:13, 17-18 tells us that those with wisdom and knowledge are to show this through meekness, to be full of the qualities of Christ and not fact spouters.

See also 1 Cor 1:8, we will not be puffed up as a result of our study but driven to humility and love of others.
