##Definition of Systematic Theology
Any study that answers the question, "What does the whole Bible teach us today?"
###Relationship to Other Disciplines
Wayne Grudems study doesn't focus on historical, philosophical or apologetic study but uses these tools to look at what the Bible says about various theological subjects.

Three other disciplines include *Old Testament Theology*, *New Testament Theology* and *Biblical Theology*. These answer questions like what can Deuteronomy say about prayer or what does Matthew say abut prayer. The question we seek to answer is what does the whole Bible say about prayer.

###Application to Life
Systematic Theology seeks to summarize doctrine as it applies to Christians today. Application is necessary to the pursuit of systematic theology. This aligns to the writers purpose of writing for practical application, not in isoloation from life.

###Systematic Theology and Disorganized Theology
This should be a study "carefully orgnanized by topics" to enhance the understanding of Biblical followers.
It should cover subjects in great detail to provide readers the ability tosummarize biblical teachings with much more accuracy.
The study must treat all scripture fairly and take into account arguments on all sides. 
This will require exegesis (interpretation) of various scriptures.
All study depends on scripture and the readers should not hold any beliefs strictly as a result of this book or any other earthly authority without being fully convinced and carefully considering for themselves that such beliefs are justified using scripture.

###What are the doctrines?
Doctrine is what the whole Bible teaches us today about some particular topic.

####The seven sections of Biblical doctrine covered:
Part 1: The Doctrine of the Word of God
Part 2: The Doctrine of God
Part 3: The Doctrine of Man
Part 4: The Doctrine of Christ and the Holy Spirit
Part 5: The Doctrine of the Application of Redemption
Part 6: The Doctrine of the Church
Part 7: The Doctrine of the Future

The emphasis of systemmatic theology is *what does God want us to believe and to know* while the emphasis of Christian ethics is *what God wants us to do and what attitudes we should seek to have*. Theology is about how we should think and ethics is about how we should live. This book will focus on what to think but will touch on application as it is the true value of having formed Biblically-aligned thinking.
